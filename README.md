![1](https://github.com/GautamRakholiya-1302/result_marking_system_Design/assets/112694190/a39da957-7458-4002-b9fe-7c36b426df96)





## Overview

This project is a simple Student Result Management System implemented in C++. It allows users to create a student, input marks, and display the student's result, including the average marks and grade.

## Features

- Create a student with a name and roll number.
- Input marks for a subject.
- Calculate and display the average marks and grade.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- PlantUML rendering tool (optional for visualizing diagrams)

## Design Principles

### 1. **Object-Oriented Design:**
   - The project uses object-oriented design with the `Student` class, encapsulating student details and related functionalities.

### 2. **Modularity:**
   - The code is organized into functions and methods with specific responsibilities, promoting modularity and readability.

### 3. **Encapsulation:**
   - The `Student` class encapsulates the internal state (name, roll number, marks) and behavior (calculating average, calculating grade).

### 4. **Abstraction:**
   - Abstraction is achieved through the use of functions like `inputMarks`, `calculateAverage`, `calculateGrade`, and `displayResult`, which hide the implementation details from the user.

### 5. **Readability and Maintainability:**
   - Descriptive variable and function names enhance readability, and the use of classes improves maintainability by encapsulating related functionalities.

### 6. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - The `Student` class adheres to SRP by having a single responsibility: managing student information and result calculations.

### 7. **User Interaction:**
   - The program interacts with the user through the console, making it accessible and user-friendly.

### 8. **Error Handling:**
   - While the code lacks extensive error handling for simplicity, a production system would include error checks for user inputs and potential issues.
